# Repository Readability

## Introduction

![overview screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/overview.png)

So far you have gone from the repository level into the content of the documents themselves, and now it's time to examine how to best annotate the content itself. 

To fully communicate the quality of your work it needs to be readable. What does readability mean? It means the most important information is highlighted and complex code is explained. Since your analysis is in a Jupyter notebook, you have the narrative of your analysis and important code all in the same place. You will use two different tools to enhance the readability of your notebook: **markdown** for the narrative and **comments** for the code. 

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Use markdown to enhance the readability of text
- Use comments to enhance the readability of code

## Markdown

Markdown is a **plain text formatting syntax**, that allows you to format text quickly without the need to write in a text editor. Markdown allows you to quickly format plain text using special characters like asterisks, dashes, underscores, etc. Markdown enables you to create headers, lists, code blocks and more without lifting your fingers off your keyboard. 

For example, which chunk of text is more readable?

**Example A:**

![plaintext example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/exercise_plaintext-example.png)

**or**

**Example B:**

![rendered text example, showing effect of markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/exercise_rendered-text-example.png)

Example B! But what makes them different? The only difference between Examples A and B is that Example B adds __Markdown__ syntax to Example A. Here is what Example B looks like before it is rendered:

```
# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Project Goal

My project aims to predict the sale price of houses.
```

### Headings example

When you use text editing software like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you use different level headings to create a consistent hierarchy of information in your documentation. H1 headings are the  highest level, like the title of the document, while H2 and H3 headings are lower in value. You denote a line is a heading by putting a hash mark next to the text, so the title in your analysis:

![example text without markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/title_without-markdown.png)

If you add one hash mark:

```
# Housing Price Prediction Project
```

The text becomes large and bold:

![example text with markdown, a single hash to make a title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/title_with-markdown.png)

The title of your analysis should have the highest level of header and your section headings, such as "Business Question" or "Data Understanding" should have H2 headings, etc. 

### Practice

You can practice your understanding of markdown using the following exercise:

1) Examine the plaintext below:

![plaintext example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/exercise_plaintext-example.png)

2) Now examine the rendered text below and find **4 examples** of markdown being used to enhance the readability of the text:

![rendered text example, showing effect of markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/exercise_rendered-text-example.png)

3) Once you have identified four examples, look at the numbered image below to confirm your answers:

![rendered text example, showing effect of markdown, now with numbers to point out changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/exercise_numbered_rendered-text-example.png)

4) Review the numbered answers listed below to confirm what was updated:

    1. headings and subheadings, used to show the organization of the file 
    2. link embedding, used to create linked text so the full text of a URL does not need to be shown
    3. bulleted list, used to effectively convey lists
    4. code text, used to show that this is the name of a variable

Try updating the text in our messy repo to match the updated formatting.

## Code Comments
 
The [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) states that "Readability counts". You covered how to make text more readable, but what about code? Enter code comments and docstrings.
 
### Comments

Code comments can show up three main ways:

#### 1) at the top, before code, to say what it will do

```
# Prints the zen of python
print(this)
```

#### 2) on the side, explaining what the code does
```
print(this) # prints the zen of python
```

#### 3) in the midst of code, telling Python to ignore that section of code and to not run it

```
# print(this)
print("something else")
```

#### Comments Example

![comments example without comments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/without-code-comments.png)

If you were given the above bit of code, you could probably figure out what was happening... but you'd need to read through the code itself, and maybe run the cells and play with the code, in order to fully follow not only what the code does but also why the code was written.

![comments example with comments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-repo-readability-v2-2/master/with-code-comments.png)

If you were instead given this bit of code above, you'd be able to instantly read through exactly what each bit was doing. The comments also clearly show why the code is running. Note that this example uses both markdown cells and code comments, for different reasons! The markdown gives an overview and more of the rationale behind the code, while the code comments talk through what each piece of code actually does.

### Docstrings

Docstrings are multi-line comments that usually explain what a _function_, _class_, or _module_ is intended to do. Whenever you type `shift+tab` in a code cell and get the documentation? The documentation is populated by docstrings written in the code itself. Examine [the source code for the Pandas groupby object](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py#L1168) to see docstrings in action. 


```
"""
docstrings are the text in triple quotes

that can take multiple lines and still not interfere
  
  
  
with the code
"""

```

Docstrings help future employers AND our future selves to understand our code at a later date. It not only makes code more readable, but makes it more _usable_ in the future.
 
#### Docstrings Example
 
```python
def summarize_dataframe(df):
    summary = pd.DataFrame(df.dtypes,columns=['dtypes'])
    summary = summary.reset_index()
    summary['Name'] = summary['index']
    summary = summary[['Name','dtypes']]
    summary['Missing'] = df.isnull().sum().values    
    summary['Uniques'] = df.nunique().values
    return summary
```

If you wanted to make the above function more readable, you could use BOTH comments and docstrings:

```python
def summarize_dataframe(df):
    '''
    Summarizes each column in a Pandas dataframe, where each row of the 
    summary output is a column of the input dataframe, df
    Will show the datatype of data in the column, the number of missing values
    in that column, and the number of unique values in the column
    -
    Input:
    df : Pandas dataframe
    -
    Output:
    summary : Pandas dataframe, now showing column details
    '''
    summary = pd.DataFrame(df.dtypes,columns=['dtypes'])
    summary = summary.reset_index()
    summary['Name'] = summary['index'] # name of each variable 
    summary = summary[['Name','dtypes']] # data type of each variable
    summary['Missing'] = df.isnull().sum().values # number of missing values  
    summary['Uniques'] = df.nunique().values # number of unique values
    return summary
```

## Summary

Great, now that you learned more about markdown and code readability, let's put this theory into practice!
